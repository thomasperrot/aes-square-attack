Homemade implementation of Square Attack against 4 rounds AES

Overview
********

This repository is a simple implementation of the Square Attack against 4 rounds AES, based on this amazing website_
(all credits goes to David Wong). The source code gathers all the functions to encrypt using 128-bit AES algorithm,
and a module dedicated to square attack.

.. warning::

   The source code has absolutely no documentation, as all you need is already provided in the above mention website,
   and documenting is pretty boring.
